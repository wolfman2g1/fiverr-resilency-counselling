    description: My name is Dr. Akisa Jones.  I am very passionate about my role as a counselor, behavioral consultant, and coach. I have a master’s in human and social services from Capella University, a master’s in philosophy, and a Ph.D. in Human and Social Services from Walden University.  I also hold certifications in Trauma Focus therapy, Mental Health Therapy, Cognitive behavioral therapy, and functional behavior assessment. I have been counseling and consulting in the field of trauma and behaviors for the past six years. I have experience in working with teens, adolescents, and adults with a wide range of concerns including sexual abuse, anger management, autism spectrum disorder, adjustment disorders, self-esteem, stress, and relationship issues. My counseling approach is eclectic or multi-modal and stems from cognitive behavioral therapy, solution-focused therapy, Trauma focus, and client-centered approaches. No client is the same so the mode of treatment and goal setting will be tailored to the needs of my client. The first step towards healing is asking for help, which takes a lot of courage to do. I am here to support you, judgment-free, and to assist you in taking the next steps to bring more joy and balance to your life. I look forward to working with you!
